Notes:
[memset]
- had to remove the condition 
"while (*p != '\0')" because the native memset just overflows lol 
~ can we use size_t natively? or do we need to make a typedef?

[memcpy]
- grrr need to test so many stuff here: when to error and when /not/ to error

[memccpy]
- good reminder that d++ returns the value of d first before adding 1 to it. :sweat_smile:

[memmove]
can you segfault by pointing to the zeroth byte (is that just null?? if yes, then moot point)and subtracting 1? 
if the very first byte is not reserved and you just loop around to the last bit, this can cause an infinite loop in line 15

[strlcpy]
check size=0
